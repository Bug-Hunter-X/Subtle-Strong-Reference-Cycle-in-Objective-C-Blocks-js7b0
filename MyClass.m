In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, it involves strong reference cycles within blocks. Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyClass *anotherClass;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)doSomething {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        NSString *newString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello from block!"];
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            weakSelf.myString = newString; // Potential strong reference cycle
        });
    });
}

- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end
```

Within the block, `weakSelf` is used to prevent a retain cycle. However, if `anotherClass` also has a strong reference back to `self`, a retain cycle may still occur, even with `weakSelf`. This happens because the `myString` property is still creating a strong reference that forms a cycle if `anotherClass` also holds a strong reference to `self`.
