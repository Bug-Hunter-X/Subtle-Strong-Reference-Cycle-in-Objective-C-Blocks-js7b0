The solution involves carefully managing the strong references and ensuring no circular dependencies. One way to break the potential cycle is to make sure that the strong reference held by `anotherClass` is broken when it is no longer needed. Or we can use a `__weak` reference in `anotherClass` to solve this issue. For example: 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@property (weak, nonatomic) MyClass *anotherClass; // Changed to weak
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)doSomething {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        NSString *newString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello from block!"];
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            if (weakSelf) {
                weakSelf.myString = newString;
            }
        });
    });
}

- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end
```
By changing `anotherClass` to a weak reference, we break the cycle.  The `if (weakSelf)` check prevents crashes in case `self` has been deallocated before the block executes.
