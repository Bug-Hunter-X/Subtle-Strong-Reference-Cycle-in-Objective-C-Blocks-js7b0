# Subtle Strong Reference Cycle in Objective-C Blocks

This repository demonstrates a subtle strong reference cycle that can occur in Objective-C even when using `__weak` self within blocks.  The issue arises when an object, in addition to referencing itself within a block, also maintains a strong reference to another object that has a strong reference back to it, thus creating a retain cycle.

The example uses Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) for asynchronous operations to highlight how this can easily occur in multithreaded environments. The `MyClass.m` file contains the buggy implementation, while `MyClassSolution.m` provides the corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe that the `MyClass` object is not deallocated (the `dealloc` method is never called in the buggy version).
5. Review the corrected implementation in `MyClassSolution.m` to understand how to correctly avoid the cycle.

## Solution

The key to fixing this is carefully managing all strong references. The solution usually involves using `__weak` references appropriately in all relevant areas, and checking for nil before using the weak references to avoid crashes.
